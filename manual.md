# --- Welcome to YouTube v2! ---

This website has a built-in tutorial but for the sake of ease, I will include a tutorial to read before going to the website.

## Concept

The concept of this website is to create tiny little sharable tokens. Input a video link and BANG! It give you a token called a Video ID. What if you were more ambitious, and wanted to store 50 whole videos in one token. Input a playlist link and BOOM! A small token holding 50 whole videos! This is called a Playlist ID.

### Indentify IDs

Here are some notes

## Menu

The menu is located on the left side of the website is used to select different menus. The different menus do different things which you will read about below.

### Playlist

The playlist menu is the playlist controls options. When a link to a playlist is provided, it will automatically fill in and the last 50 video on the selected playlist will appear.

### Controls

The control menu is the core of the website. It house the converter, the website controls and the video controls. These are essential to the program and a lack of these will cause the program to crash.

## Usage

Now for the usage of this website. I mean, what is the point of a website if you don't know how to use it?

### Getting A Video ID

To get a Video ID, you must first get the link of the video. First retrieving the link, you press the Controls menu and locate the word, Link Goes Here. Paste in your link there and press Submit Link. This will produce a Video ID for to use.

### Playing A Video

If you follow the last topic on how to get an ID, then the website should have automatically play the resulting Video ID. But let's say your friend gave you an ID. Just type the ID into the box, that says ID Goes Here. Then, press Submit ID and the display should change into your friend's video.
