# --- Welcome to YouTube v2! ---

This website has a built-in tutorial but for the sake of ease, I will include a tutorial to read before going to the website.

## Concept

The concept of this website is to create tiny little sharable tokens. Input a video link and BANG! It give you a token called a Video ID. What if you were more ambitious, and wanted to store 50 whole videos in one token. Input a playlist link and BOOM! A small token holding 50 whole videos! This is called a Playlist ID.

### ID Notes

Here are all the notes about IDs of both types:

* A Video ID is always written like this: id=randomletters

* A Playlist ID is always written like this: list=randomletters

## Menu

The menu is located on the left side of the website is used to select different menus. The different menus do different things which you will read about below.

### Playlist

The playlist menu is the playlist controls options. When a link to a playlist is provided, it will automatically fill in and the last 50 video on the selected playlist will appear.

### Controls

The control menu is the core of the website. It house the converter, the website controls and the video controls. These are essential to the program and a lack of these will cause the program to crash.
